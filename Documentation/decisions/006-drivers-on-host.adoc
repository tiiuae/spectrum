== Status

Accepted

== Context

It's important to minimize the amount of software in Spectrum's Trusted
Computing Base (TCB).

== Decision

As few drivers as possible should be running on the Spectrum host.

== Consequences

- No networking on the host.
- Responsibilities of the host are expected to get smaller over time.
- More flexible management of devices. We need to decouple devices from the host
  based on their class -- like net, usb, bluetooth and GUI -- and pass them
  through to their respective device VMs.
