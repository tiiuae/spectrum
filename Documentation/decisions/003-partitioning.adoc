## Status
Proposed

## Context
Partitions are required to install the Spectrum OS, VMs and store user data.

## Decision
----
<blockdevice>                        # EFI system partition
<blockdevice>                        # XBOOTLDR
<blockdevice>                        # A
<blockdevice>                        # B
# first 32 GB are reserved for Spectrum system
# rest of the disk is reserved for user data
<blockdevice>n-1                     # bootstrap user data
<blockdevice>n to the end of disk    # user data
----

## Consequences
LVM may support resizing - both increasing and decreasing with some limitation
when there's alreay data on volume(s). Does LVM work with all disk types? We
have to implement XBOOTLDR to support EFI system partition created by Windows -
to support dual boot
